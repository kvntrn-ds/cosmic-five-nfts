# Cosmic Five NFT Collection

1,000 unique personality-driven generative artworks mapping Big Five (OCEAN) traits to the Lorenz attractor from chaos theory. The process involved uploading metadata and image files to Storacha using IPFS to generate the CID. The CID's were then used to update the JSON files and then uploaded again to get the CID for the metadata. This was then used in thirdweb where I uploaded my NFTs and allowed it to be claimed and minted where it would then be shown on marketplaces such as OpenSea.

Behind every Cosmic Soul lies the Lorenz attractor — the butterfly-shaped equations that birthed modern chaos theory. Here, the three parameters are no longer abstract numbers, but direct reflections of human personality:
Sigma (σ) — driven by Openness — spreads vast, daring wings of possibility.
Rho (ρ) — fueled by Neuroticism — injects wild turbulence and emotional storms.
Beta (β) — shaped by Conscientiousness — controls structure and discipline.Glow intensity and palette blending emerge from the interplay of Extraversion and Agreeableness.
What begins as cold differential equations becomes a radiant dust cloud — an unreproducible visual portrait of the hidden geometry that makes you, you.This is not random art. It is the exquisite, chaotic mathematics living inside every human soul.
Your unique personality traits dictate what shape and colours your cosmic dust will look like.

The result: ethereal dust clouds — visual portraits of the hidden mathematics inside every human soul.
